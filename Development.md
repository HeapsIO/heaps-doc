# Development

These are concepts, ideas and workflows that can help you working with Heaps, especially since it is an engine that gives you the ***freedom***, hence the ***demand*** or ***challenge*** to get into **engine programming** and **software engineering** overall.

- see the "Game dev" section on the right under https://deepnight.net/tutorials/, this currently involves:
  - [Entity and coordinate system](https://deepnight.net/tutorial/a-simple-platformer-engine-part-1-basics/)
  - [collision checking](https://deepnight.net/tutorial/a-simple-platformer-engine-part-2-collisions/)
  - [Bresenham algorithm](https://deepnight.net/tutorial/bresenham-magic-raycasting-line-of-sight-pathfinding/)
