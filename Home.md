**Heaps** is a cross platform graphics engine designed for high performance games by leveraging modern GPUs that are commonly available on both desktop and mobile devices. 

Heaps is currently working on:

- HTML5 (requires WebGL1, WebGL2 is supported as well)
- Mobile (iOS, Android, and tvOS)
- Desktop with OpenGL (Win/Linux/OSX) or DirectX (Windows only)
- Consoles (Nintendo Switch, Sony PS4, XBox One - requires being a registered developer)
- Flash Stage3D

The Heaps API is comprised of several top level packages, namely:

- [`h2d`](https://github.com/ncannasse/heaps/wiki/H2D) used for 2D display (for 2D games and user interfaces)
- [`h3d`](https://github.com/ncannasse/heaps/wiki/H3D) used for rendering 3D models
- [`hxd`](https://github.com/ncannasse/heaps/wiki/HXD) contains cross platform classes such as Bitmaps, and a complete resource loading and management framework
- [`hxsl`](https://github.com/ncannasse/heaps/wiki/Shaders) is the Heaps Shader Language implementation
