# 2D Camera

In 2D the camera is implemented as [`h2d.Camera`](https://heaps.io/api/h2d/Camera.html). This object is by default part of any `h2d.Scene` and can be accessed via `camera` as well as `cameras` which saves the whole array of cameras available to the current scene.

## Sample

A sample that explains the `h2d.Camera` functionality in detail can be found in the github repository:

(Reminder: This file will already be on your local machine in the `HaxeToolkit\haxe\lib\heaps\git\samples` folder)
