### ⚠️ Common pitfalls + FAQ

[Unofficial Heaps FAQ](https://gist.github.com/Yanrishatum/ae3725a9e2b45e0766c065e573ed1f24#an-unofficial-heaps-faq)

### ⭐️ Github samples

Besides the [samples you can run online on the Heaps site](https://heaps.io/samples/) you should try the many [**samples from the github repository**](https://github.com/HeapsIO/heaps/#samples).

There are many samples that haven't yet been added to the site of Heaps. The samples are already in your Haxe's Heaps folder on your local machine: `HaxeToolkit\haxe\lib\heaps\git\samples`. 

When compiling the `all.hxml` file all samples should get compiled (which currently takes about 227 MB of disk space).
