# Installation

In order to get up and running Heaps you'll need to make a decision about how you would like to run and debug your project.

## Installing Haxe and Heaps

**1. Download and setup Haxe:**

<a href="https://haxe.org/download"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/576184/3142589/5e2c41a0-e9c9-11e3-9608-75ec07df40e7.png" align="left" height="30"/></a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://haxe.org/download/">Haxe 3.4.2+</a>

If you plan on testing with HashLink, however, you will need to download the [Latest Haxe 4 Release Candidate](https://haxe.org/download/list/) from the website.

**2. Download and setup Heaps by running:**

```
haxelib install heaps
```
Or alternatively use github repo for more up-to-date version:
```
haxelib git heaps https://github.com/HeapsIO/heaps.git
```

## Installing Visual Studio Code + Haxe support

The recommended editor for creating Heaps applications is Visual Studio Code:

**1. Download and setup VSCode:**

**2. Install Haxe Extension Pack:**

Click on the **Extension** panel (fourth icon on the left side bar of VSCode), search `haxe` and install **Haxe Extension Pack** that will contain everything you need for Haxe support.

If your VSCode is up to date (after v1.31), you're good to go. Otherwise, restart VSCode once installation is complete (you can click the `Reload` label that should be showing)

## Additional steps for Heaps and HashLink VM
 
In addition to use Heaps.io with [HashLink](http://hashlink.haxe.org) (also known as HL), you need to install: 

 * [HashLink](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hashlink/releases) Virtual Machine
   * On OSX, you will have to follow the instructions laid out [here](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hashlink#building-on-linuxosx) to get set up with Hashlink, as the process is a little different.
 * Instead of Haxe 3.4 you need latest [Haxe 4 Release Candidate](https://haxe.org/download/list/)
 * Some additional libraries should be installed with `haxelib install <lib>` command 
   * Install Haxelib [hldx](https://lib.haxe.org/p/hldx) for DirectX support
   * Install Haxelib [hlopenal](https://lib.haxe.org/p/hlopenal) for OpenAL support
   * Install Haxelib [hlsdl](https://lib.haxe.org/p/hlsdl) for SDL/GL support

Once you've downloaded the HashLink binary you'll want to add it to your system PATH [(tutorial)](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm). 

Once everything is setup, you should be able to run `hl` command from your terminal:
